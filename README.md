>> Note : This project cannot be deployed cause, this app contains json-server as fake api server which cannot be deployed online.
>> So, All we have to do is create restful api's or use firebase or online cloud servers which can be deployed online.
>> This is my learning from making this basic project. I hope this can help beginner level developers not to make any mistakes.
>> Ofcourse, you can use json-server as fake api server for learning and creating projects on development time but not on production time.

# A Blog App || Real Bites 
>> It's a Basic Authenticated and Post Delivering App, where you can do CRUD operations.
>> You can showcase your posts(bites) online where you can captivate the readers and bloggers online.
>> I have developed this app with protecting routes concepts with react-router-dom.
>> I have used redux state management to provide all my states to all components seemlessly without re-rendering the webpages which is to overcome prop-drilling issues over app.
>> I have used redux thunk middleware to deal with API's so that we can fetch data asynchronously.
>> Here , I have used the json-web-server to store all datas of posts and users.
