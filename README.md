A Blog App || Real Bites 
>> It's a Basic Authenticated and Post Delivering App, where you can do CRUD operations.
>> You can showcase your posts online where you can captivate the readers and bloggers online.
>> I have developed this app with protecting routes concepts with react-router-dom.
>> I have used redux state management to provide all my states to all components seemlessly without re-rendering the webpages.
>> I have used redux thunk middleware to deal with API's so that we can fetch data asynchronously.
>> Here , I have used the json-web-server to store all datas of posts and users.
